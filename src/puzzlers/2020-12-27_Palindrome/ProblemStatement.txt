============================PROBLEM STATEMENT===================================
Think of a familiar two-word phrase (5, 2).
Replace the last letter with the next letter of the alphabet.
The result will be a palindrome (the seven letters will read backward and forward the same).
What phrase is it?

============================SCRATCH NOTES===================================

The problem statement does NOT specify that the palindrome needs to be a single word.

This won't work...b/c it assumes single word palindromes
1. Search for all 7-letter Palindromes.
2. Split into two partitions (5, 2). Replace last letter with previous letter of the alphabet.
3. Check if both halves are words.
4. (Manually) check if it's a phrase.



Try the other direction
1. Generate all (5,2) word combinations
2. Try replacing last letter.
3. Check if it's a palindrome
    Need to search different partition variations


Search for all 7-letter palindromes
1. For i in 1:N , where N = # of words in the palindrome (assumed e.g. max 3)
2. For each word in the dictionary (j = i)
3. while j > 0,
    add the (word, drow)  to the phrase "in the middle"
    if j == 1, only add the word,
    j--,

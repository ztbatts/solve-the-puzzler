============================PROBLEM STATEMENT===================================
Take the name BUENOS AIRES.

Remove one letter.

The remaining letters can be rearranged to name
two things that many people wish for around this time of year.

What are they?

============================SCRATCH NOTES===================================

STRATEGY -- brute force search thru all letter combinations:

BUENOSAIRES (len = N = 11) -> remove 1 letter -> (combos = N different ranges of size (N-1))
-> get all different orderings -> (*= factorial(N-1))
-> get all different partitions -> (*= (N-1))
-> check if both halves of partition are in the dictionary -> (*= O(log(length(dictionary))))

Starting in Montana, you can drive into South Dakota and then into Iowa.
Those three states have the postal abbreviations MT, SD, and IA â€”
whose letters can be rearranged to spell AMIDST.

The challenge is to do this with four connected states to make an eight-letter word.
That is, start in a certain state, drive to another, then another, and then another.
Take the postal abbreviations of the four states you visit, mix the letters up, and
use them to spell a common eight-letter word.

Derrick and I know of only one answer.

Can you do this?

##### NOTES #####
Can do a couple brute-force approaches.

"Forward Approach"
1. Go thru 4-state combinations (50 choose 4 = 5527200)
2. Go thru each 8-letter permutation ( *= (8 factorial = 40320)
3. Check if the word exists in the dictionary ( *= (dict size ~ 10000))

"Backward approach" (sounds quicker)
1. Sort each word in the dictionary ( N * k * log(k) ... not too bad ... one time cost)
   Create a map/dict from {sorted : original}
2. Go thru each 4-state combo
3. Sort the combo
4. Find the combo in the dictionary


* it's a "common" word, so can probably use a slim dictionary of 10,000 words.
